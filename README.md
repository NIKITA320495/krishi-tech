## Krishi-Tech +

**KrishiTech is an innovative startup and hackathon project developed by four passionate students: Piyush, Nikita, Manya, and Ritwick. We are currently pursuing our B.Tech degrees in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science from the University School of Automation & Robotics, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. <br>
Our mission is to revolutionize farming practices and improve the livelihoods of farmers by leveraging the power of technology.**

### Goal üéØ
**KRISHI-TECH + aids farmers using ML for optimal fertilizers, profitable crops, disease prediction. Features: educational blogs, AI chatbot, marketplace linking farmers to buyers, and a sensor simulator.**

**The KRISHI-TECH + platform serves as a comprehensive solution for farmers, utilizing machine learning to address key challenges such as determining the optimal fertilizer, selecting crops for maximum profit, and predicting crop diseases. The primary features of the KRISHI-TECH platform include:**

**Educating Farmers: The disease prediction model can identify diseases not commonly found in a particular area, allowing farmers to choose the appropriate fertilizer or treatment. Additionally, the blog section on KRISHI-TECH keeps farmers informed about the latest developments in agriculture.**

**Chatbot Assistance: The integrated chatbot leverages a diverse knowledge base and artificial intelligence to answer farmers' queries. It can also suggest government schemes and financial assistance, reducing stress and enhancing profitability for the farming community.**

**Marketplace: The marketplace feature connects farmers with buyers from different regions, increasing demand for their produce and providing access to new markets. This platform bridges the gap between farmers and potential buyers, helping farmers reach a broader audience.**

**Live Data Retrieval: For better results, live data is extracted from sensors. Krishi-Tech utilizes three sensors: an NPK sensor, a soil moisture sensor, and a temperature sensor. All three sensors are deployed using an Arduino Nano. The microprocessor processes the analog signals received from the sensors and then, using a Bluetooth module or cloud service, sends this data to our Krishi-Tech interface. This data is then utilized by the ML models to make predictions regarding the crop, fertilizer, and necessary improvements in crop care.**

### Model(s) used for the Web App üßÆ
**The Models used for crop recommendation is convolutional neural network(CNN) and disease predection is support vector machine (SVM) , with the fertilizer recommendation we used the random forest algorithum**
